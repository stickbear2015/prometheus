Jakaran Green Designation (lying on the ground) is here, sleeping.
You can go east and west.

Sorry, but no help is available on `perl diving'.
help pearl diving
What is pearl diving?
Pearl diving is the process of diving into a deep source of water, such as an ocean, and attempting to find valuable pearls from the bottom of it.
How does it work?
Currently, the only pearl diving area is on Earth.
So get to Earth and map the pearl diving store.
Once there, buy one of each item listed, you will need all of them eventually.
Then, wear the diving suit, the scanner, the container and the shovel.
You should now be ready for pearl diving!
Head to the room that has the title of 'On the ocean shore'. Then go down. Your character should begin diving and, after a few seconds, reach the bottom of the ocean.
Now you will have to use the scanner to scan the area. So type 'use scanner', and see if you can find any valuable pearls nearby. The scanner will notify you of the coordinates if it finds any pearls.
Move to the coordinates told by the scanner, if any, and use the scanner again to determine the pearl's depth.
Then you should use the shovel and dig as long as it takes for you to reach the depth of the pearl. At that point the pearl should move to your inventory, and you should be able to put it in the oceanography container that you bought.
You can estimate the container with the estimate' command.
Note: The oxygen compartment of the diving suit only holds enough oxygen for an hour. The suit will notify you when the oxygen level gets low, at which point you should type 'up' to reach the surface and climb out of the water. 'Up' is also the command used to stop diving at any point, regardless of your suit's oxygen level.
If the suit's oxygen runs low, you can refill it. Use 'refill diving' when not underwater, and the oxygen compartment will be refilled if you have an oxygen tank with you.
When you are finished diving for pearls, go to the pearl diving research facility and type 'research' to receive your reward.
Happy diving!

This large grassy area bordered by spruce trees. The grass is kept relatively short and neat, although closer to the tree line small bushes and clumps of other groundcover begin to encroach upon the area. A very large stone sheet has been carefully laid in the center of the clearing, allowing a safe place for multiple ships to park. To the west a set of steps made from round, natural looking stones leads up into the forest. Next to the steps is a small metal bench and a trashcan bearing the words 'Keep Earth Clean'.

As the nerve point of any starship, this large area is circular in nature, providing a window to the world beyond and within to other areas of the starship's interior.  Blinking monitors of blue, green and white hum and beep cheerfully, status reports of engines, weapons and records in clear focus and easily spotted.  Below each of these, small white arrows point to labeled controls, each softly beeping and blinking a gentle sky-blue glow as power reaches them.  At about waist-level, a microphone rests before a hidden speaker, upon which two small readouts spell the words launch and land in deep blue.

[Malacia; Docking Platform]
This is the spaceport center of a huge planet. People can be seen rushing here and there, going about their business and chatting idly. The ceiling is full of different star clusters, which move so realistically that you feel like you're under the sky, instead of inside a structure. Some people are moving toward the big hatch leading out of this spaceport and deep into the planet itself, toward something that looks like a huge, paved road. The traffic of starships launching, landing, and being transported from and into the garage, creates a constant gentle hum in the background. Some pilots look concerned and walk hurriedly towards the northeastern entrance, a sign above it reading 'REPAIR YOUR VESSLES'. There are four wide corridors stretching out of this spaceport center like a cross, each continuing far out of sight. The pilots coming out of the corridors seem excited, maybe there's something to buy there? Below, situated in a hole almost as big as the docking area, is a stack of hovering platforms which people use to descend into the garage and back.

The only things of note that can be seen here are a number of consoles installed along the northern wall to allow the starship's engineer to send instructions to the repair drones, along with a massive diagram of the ship that has been projected onto an equally massive screen above the consoles. A small starmap viewing terminal stands beside the repair consoles, its screen flashing with information about the ship's current location.

The overhead lights glow brightly, indicating that the ship is powered up. Through the windows, you see that the ship is at Malacia; Docking Platform. The battle lanterns glow green, indicating that the starship's crew should stand at ease.

"Dizzy Devil" Docking Arm
This square room has been completely constructed from ultra-strong vanadium steel plates that have been painted battleship grey. Two massive force field generators have been positioned on either side of a set of two-meter-thick tritanium doors at one end of this room, along with a pair of pneumatic pumps located just behind the generators. When activated, these would both allow a docking starship to pass between the doors and  keep the vacuum of space from entering the area.
The deck plating underfoot has been specially treated so that starships can enter and land here without melting the metal. Long, narrow lighting strips located near the walls act as guiding beacons for approaching vessels, while large round spotlights hanging from brackets on the ceiling provide illumination for any personnel entering this part of the ship.

"Dizzy Devil" Supply Arm
This is a large rectangular room whose walls and floor have been paneled in mahogany and oak. The ceiling, however, has been constructed from a single domed pane of transparasteel, allowing the room's occupents to gaze out upon the vessel's immediate surroundings. a small menu terminal stands near one wall, its screen flashing a list of items that may be purchased, along with a smaller screen that displays the current inventory count. A stirdy door installed in the opposite wall leads back out into the rest of the vessel.

"Dizzy Devil" Storage Arm
The sides of this long, low ceilinged storage area are lined with downward folding metal racks that are secured to the bulkheads with magnetic strips when not in use, and a climate control unit and ventalation system keep the air dry and the temperature nutral. Tiedowns for crates and cargo containers are spaced evenly across the greated metal deck under your feet, and the rumble of the ships powerful engines can be heard only faintly.

"Dizzy Devil" Refreshments Arm
This square room is small but tastefully decorated. Polished planks of maple make up the floor, while the walls are of oak and mahogany painted in chestnut brown. The ceiling overhead has been constructed from a single pane of transparasteel, allowing the occupents to gaze out upon the starship's surroundings. A small menu terminal stands near the door that leads back out into the rest of the ship, its screen flashing a list of foods and drinks that may be acquired.

["Dizzy Devil" Airlock] [Starship Power: Off]
The distant hum of the starship's engines can be heard here, though much less than within the ship. A hatch opens just beyond, allowing you entrance into the main area of the spacecraft, while behind you, another hatch slides open and closed to allow you to enter or exit this part of the ship. White lights gleam overhead, and the floor rumbles ever so gently beneath your feet.

The overhead lights glow softly, indicating that the ship is powered down. Through the windows, you see that the ship is at Malacia; Starship Garage. The battle lanterns glow green, indicating that the starship's crew should stand at ease.

[Malacia; Starship Garage]
The starship garage is a huge place. Longterm docking platforms support hundreds of ships from small shuttles to deadly harpoons. To the side of 1 wall, a pair of robotic arms lifts starships in and out of the garage with a loud hum.

["Travel we shall go" airlock] [Starship Power: On]
Lit by bright overhead lights, and  having thick  armored beige  walls, the main airlock of this ship is designed to keep the outside out, and the inside in.  The floor is not carpetted, but is merely composed of thick grey metal.  The heavy hatch leading further into the ship mirrors the outer door, though both do have small windows for viewing what's beyond.  
A small control panel is located to one side of the exterior hatch, to control various aspects of this lock.  The deck underfoot vibrates very slightly, but given it and the walls are very thick, the noise from the ship is muffled here.

Plush blue carpet covers the deck in this broad corridor, while the highly-polished oak paneled walls glow in the light from the ceiling.  Carved into the wall paneling, ocean waves seem to roll from horizon to horizon, their tops ruffled by a passing breeze.
Operating silently, polished metal doors allow access to the various support areas aboard this vessel.

["Travel we shall go" Main Bridge] [Starship Power: On]
Like the vesel it is located on, this bridge is round, with control consoles located in a half-circole in the center of the room, with the positions for the captain and co-captain in the middle of this arrangement.  
Though a viewscreen does occupy the lower half of the  forward wall, those manning this bridge have another way to observe their surroundings outside this ship, as the entire uper half of this room is composed of an armored, but transparent dome, giving a full 360-degree view.
The lower half of the walls, which are not transparent, are colored a deep beige, while a dark grey carpet covers the deck, and muffles footfalls.  
A short set of spiral stairs leads down from the rear of this bridge, to the lower section of this vessel.

["everything is done here" Control Room] [Starship Power: On]
As the nerve point of any starship, this large area is circular in nature, providing a window to the world beyond and within to other areas of the starship's interior.  Blinking monitors of blue, green and white hum and beep cheerfully, status reports of engines, weapons and records in clear focus and easily spotted.  Below each of these, small white arrows point to labeled controls, each softly beeping and blinking a gentle sky-blue glow as power reaches them.  At about waist-level, a microphone rests before a hidden speaker, upon which two small readouts spell the words launch and land in deep blue.
