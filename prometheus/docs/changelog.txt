Prometheus Soundpack Changes:

++Version 24.10.1

* Hopefully fixed a lot of broken stuff.  Including, but limited to the teleportation and phasing sound mixups.
  In fact, that is primarily what this release is. a bug fix release. Please let me know if anything is still broken.
* My thanks to the red breasted robin for helping me out with some new room sounds, and the addition of a bunch of new helpful aliases.
  I guess I owe him a big bag of bird seed or something. grins.

++Version 23.5.1
This update includes a lot of under the hood changes to allow me  to work more effectively on new sounds and features.
Future releases will also include some changes like these. Maybe you will notice some small performance improvements, or new bugs that come up.
I'm going to try for smaller updates on a more regular basis with shorter update cycles.
Changes in this update:
* Changed the version number to a system kind of  like the one NVDA uses, as I thought it would be easier to understand for you guys, and easier for me to change each time. Seeing as it comes out as, year.month.UpdateNumber
* Introducing the sphelp alias. This will be your goto destination for any help related to this soundpack.
* Replaced mushreader with a more modern plugin utilizing tolk or SAPI for speech output. see 'sphelp tts' for more information.
