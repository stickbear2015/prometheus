Description: Navigation via the keypad on ground and in space.
With your keypad, usually on the right side of a full sized keyboard, you can navigate your character or ship in prometheus.
For this just enable your keypad on the upper left side of the keypad.
The directions are as follows:
North -> 8, northeast -> 9 east -> 6, south -> 2, west -> 4
The decimal key toggles between walking and navigation mode for you
Press and hold either ctrl for upward directions or alt for downward directions while walking.
Example: you want to go northup, then the keystroke would be ctrl+8.
Or you want to go southwestdown, then the keystroke would be alt+1.
The add key brings you down, while the subtract key brings you up.
Other numpad commands are as follows:
keypad5 -> look.
devide -> in
multiply -> out
alt+devide -> enter (for ships)
alt+multiply -> exit (for mining vehicles)

For more information on ship navigation and manual pilot please take a look at the very good in game help files.
Note: ctrl and alt work the same as for walking directions in navigation mode. Patterns that contain these additional directions can be flied easily with those commands.
Additional commands while in navigation mode:
numpad5 -> coordinates
devide -> smc (star map coordinates)
multiply -> nst (nearest selectable target)
