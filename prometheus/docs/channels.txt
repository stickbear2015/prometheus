Description: Buffered channel messages.
    Channel history plugin shortcuts
history_save_limit - when typed with nothing after, this opens a dialog which let's you set the limit for the save messages feature. You can also provide a number after to set that directly without opening the dialog.
Accelerator keys:
alt+right and alt+left - next and previous category buffer
shift+alt+right and left  - move currently selected buffer.
alt + shift + Delete - delete a buffer.
alt+1 through alt+0 - read 1st to 10th latest message in buffer. pressing one of these keys twice within 0.5 seconds will copy the message to the clipboard, and 3 times will paste it into the command window.
alt+shift+1-0: jump to first through tenth buffer
Alt + shift + ` (grave accent)( also works without shift) - If you have some text typed in the command window, try to jump to a buffer starting with that text. Press the command with the window empty to return to where you were before the last jump. Effectively it lets you flip between two buffers this way.
Alt+up or Alt+ Down Arrow - move through messages in the current buffer. The latest messages are at the bottom of the buffer.
Alt + Pageup or Alt + PageDown - move up or down 10 messages in the current buffer.
Alt + Home or Alt + End - Move up or down 2000 messages in the current buffer
Alt + Space - Repeat currently selected buffer item
Alt + Shift + Space - Copy selected buffer item to clipboard
Alt + Enter - Open URLs in the current buffer item if any, otherwise open the world configuration dialog
Alt + Shift + Enter - Copy all items in current buffer to an output window
Alt + Backslash: If you have some text typed in the command window, searches toward the bottom of the current buffer for that text. Add shift to search toward the top of the buffer. If a match is found, focus jumps to that message.
Alt + Shift + T - Toggle hearing a relative time announcement after each message, such as 2 minutes ago.
Alt + shift + i - Opens a dialog box which let's you select categories to ignore (and vice versa). Handy if you don't care about messages from a certain category.
Alt + shift + s - toggle saving of the last 100 messages in each buffer. These will be reloaded and available when the client starts back up or the plugin is reinstalled. The limit is configurable (see history_save_limit alias).
