This large, spacious starship control room contains computer terminals, control boards, and other various devices.

One of the walls of the control room is devoted to a large window which looks out to the area beyond.
You see a red cherrywood king bed with aqua cotton sheets and huge black pillows here. A huge red metal trashcan is standing in a corner. A black fridge with an icemaker built into it" is here, humming quietly.
The overhead lights glow brightly, indicating that the ship is powered up. Through the windows, you see that the ship is in space. The battle lanterns glow green, indicating that the starship's crew should stand at ease.
You see a black in-ship recharging station, a black starship simulator, and a black wormhole transport console here.

Stepping foot into this room you see that a lot of the important stuff has been taken away. Blank, emotionless cliffs greet you on every side, stretching their giant bodies into the sky and giving the area a deep, creepy darkness. The gravel like stones continue, though it is only now you see the bits of blood that stane the underside of the stones as you kick them about, looking for an artifact or two. Several markings have been etched into the cliffs though what they may have been has been rubbed out by the endless erosion of time. The heat continues to rise from the ground, becoming hotter the more time carries on until steam almost seems to be rising from the ground.

Stepping foot into this room you see that a lot of the important stuff has been taken away. Blank, emotionless cliffs greet you on every side, stretching their giant bodies into the sky and giving the area a deep, creepy darkness. The gravel like stones continue, though it is only now you see the bits of blood that stane the underside of the stones as you kick them about, looking for an artifact or two. Several markings have been etched into the cliffs though what they may have been has been rubbed out by the endless erosion of time. The heat continues to rise from the ground, becoming hotter the more time carries on until steam almost seems to be rising from the ground.

You see a tiny computer chip floating in space beside you.
You see a vessel floating silently nearby.
You see what must be the fabric of space. A pulsing blackness, an utter nothingness. No sound can be heard here, and the total lack of breatheable air would send you to a swift death, were it not for the protection given to you by your spacesuit. From a vast, incomprehensible distance, you can see tiny lights, possibly coming from both planets and stars alike. The temperature here is colder than anything you have ever felt, and the darkness of the void that surrounds you seems to suck you into the depths of its embrace.
You snatch a tiny computer chip from the cold, cruel hands of space.

Stepping foot into this room you see that a lot of the important stuff has been taken away. Blank, emotionless cliffs greet you on every side, stretching their giant bodies into the sky and giving the area a deep, creepy darkness. The gravel like stones continue, though it is only now you see the bits of blood that stane the underside of the stones as you kick them about, looking for an artifact or two. Several markings have been etched into the cliffs though what they may have been has been rubbed out by the endless erosion of time. The heat continues to rise from the ground, becoming hotter the more time carries on until steam almost seems to be rising from the ground.

Stepping foot into this room you see that a lot of the important stuff has been taken away. Blank, emotionless cliffs greet you on every side, stretching their giant bodies into the sky and giving the area a deep, creepy darkness. The gravel like stones continue, though it is only now you see the bits of blood that stane the underside of the stones as you kick them about, looking for an artifact or two. Several markings have been etched into the cliffs though what they may have been has been rubbed out by the endless erosion of time. The heat continues to rise from the ground, becoming hotter the more time carries on until steam almost seems to be rising from the ground.
You see a glowing sphere with swirling liquid inside it, a lifeless alien tentacle, a stasis pod, and the corpse of an alien creature (2) here.

Stepping foot into this room you see that a lot of the important stuff has been taken away.

Several markings have been etched into the cliffs though what they may have been has been rubbed out by the endless erosion of time.

Stepping foot into this room you see that a lot of the important stuff has been taken away. Blank, emotionless cliffs greet you on every side, stretching their giant bodies into the sky and giving the area a deep, creepy darkness. The gravel like stones continue, though it is only now you see the bits of blood that stane the underside of the stones as you kick them about, looking for an artifact or two. Several markings have been etched into the cliffs though what they may have been has been rubbed out by the endless erosion of time. The heat continues to rise from the ground, becoming hotter the more time carries on until steam almost seems to be rising from the ground.
You can go east and southwest.
