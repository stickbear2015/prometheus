* Hopefully fixed more broken stuff.
  My thanks to Kira Andrews for all her help in tracking down bugs.
* The repair sound should no longer play twice when you begin repairs on a mining vehicle.
* The notification sound for material packs should now play even if there are more than one of them present.
* Game change notifications are no longer omitted from the output window.
* Also notification sounds have been added for holloween pumpkins, christmas Bells, and chocolate boxes.

  I'm still trying to track down why the words wear, and remove play their sounds when they shouldn't.

++Version 24.10.1

* Hopefully fixed a lot of broken stuff.  Including, but limited to the teleportation and phasing sound mixups.
  In fact, that is primarily what this release is. a bug fix release. Please let me know if anything is still broken.
* My thanks to the red breasted robin for helping me out with some new room sounds, and the addition of a bunch of new helpful aliases.
  I guess I owe him a big bag of bird seed or something. grins.

++Version 23.5.1
This update includes a lot of under the hood changes to allow me  to work more effectively on new sounds and features.
Future releases will also include some changes like these. Maybe you will notice some small performance improvements, or new bugs that come up.
I'm going to try for smaller updates on a more regular basis with shorter update cycles.
Changes in this update:
* Changed the version number to a system kind of  like the one NVDA uses, as I thought it would be easier to understand for you guys, and easier for me to change each time. Seeing as it comes out as, year.month.UpdateNumber
* Introducing the sphelp alias. This will be your goto destination for any help related to this soundpack.
* Replaced mushreader with a more modern plugin utilizing tolk or SAPI for speech output. see 'sphelp tts' for more information.

* Enhanced keypad navigation for all directions, including: in, exit and the up and down directions. See 'sphelp keypad'.
* Ftts now keeps its state beyond restarts of MUSHclient.
