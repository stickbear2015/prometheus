Welcome to the Prometheus Soundpack!
====================================

Thanks for downloading and installing the soundpack. This package is for the awesome MOO called Eternal Wars as known as Prometheus. Please, you should use this soundpack just for this game only. If you run this soundpack in other games, these sounds won't work, of course.

Before you run the 'MUSHclient.exe' file from the main directory, make sure you run it as an administrator by right clicking or press the context menu key on that executable file and choose the entry 'Run as administrator'.

Perhaps, if you play this MOO at the first time, you need to set a few options in the game with the OPTIONS command.

------------------------------------

Options Menu:
[1]: Ship Options
[2]: Communicator Options
[3]: Look Options
[4]: Mapping options
[5]: Shop Options
[6]: WHO Options
[7]: Miscellaneous Options
[8]: Exit

If you are using a screen reader, you can enable first the blind mode. This options is in the Look Options.

In the Ship Options enable the Show Power Status in Ship Room Titles. Check the option Starmap Style is set to Coordinate-based.

In the Who Options, I would recommend to disable Who output in proper columns. Output text won't cut off in the WHO list. If not, I would recommend to turn the Who Output to Modern.

In the Miscellaneous Options enable the Announcing self-movement with normal exits, and set the Exit movement style to Soundpack-compatible.

All other options feel free to change like you want it.
