Welcome to the Prometheus Soundpack!
====================================

Thanks for downloading and installing the Prometheus soundpack with MUSHclient bundled!

This package is for the awesome MOO called Eternal Wars as known as Prometheus. Please, you should use this soundpack just for this game only. If you run this soundpack in other games, these sounds won't work, of course.

If you haven't played this game before, you need to set a few options in the game with the OPTIONS command.

Otherwise, I always recommend to take a look into the change log after updating to see what has been added, updated, changed, or removed in this soundpack.

If you are using a screen reader, you can enable first the blind mode.
You can set it by typing SIGHT if it's already not set yet. 

In the Ship Options enable the Show Power Status in Ship Room Titles. Check the option Starmap Style is set to Coordinate-based.

In the Who Options, I would recommend to disable Who output in proper columns. Output text won't cut off in the WHO list. If not, I would recommend to turn the Who Output to Modern.

In the Miscellaneous Options enable the Announcing self-movement with normal exits, and set the Exit movement style to Soundpack-compatible.

Feel free to change the other options of the game like you want it.
