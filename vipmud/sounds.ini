' Sound Buffers.
' If you are having problems with system resources, 
' you may want to change this value.
' Lower values would help with systems with limited 
' memory on the card or computer.
 ' Higher values would help systems with lots of memory, 
' but slower disk I/O or processing power.
SOUND BUFFERS = 100 'value must be between 20 and 100
'
' Software Buffers.
' Setting this value will keep all the waves off the 
' card's memory and keep it in the computer's memory. 
' usually, the system will work faster if this is 
' set to 0.
SOFTWARE BUFFERS = 0 ' 1 is on, 0 is off.
'
' Modify Frequency.
' Some sound cards do not handle changes in sound 
' frequencies well.  Change this to 0 if your card has 
' problems with this. 
MODIFY FREQUENCY = 0 ' 1 is on, 0 is off.
'
' Minimal Sounds.
' Set the following when you want to cut out "fluff" 
' sounds.  This will reduce the workload on your system, 
' but reduce the "richness" in sounds.  
' this is usually combined with a lower Sound Buffers 
' setting, and removal of optional sounds such as songs.
MINIMAL SOUNDS = 0 ' 1 indicates on, 0 is off.
