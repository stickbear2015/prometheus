Prometheus Soundpack installation instructions

Here are some instructions on how to get set up with the VIP Mud soundpack for Prometheus. Hopefully everything will work if you follow them.

*** Note1: These instructions assume that you are using VIP Mud 2.0. Installation instructions for VIP Mud 1.1.1 are beyond the scope of this document. ***
*** Note2: Please ensure that you have created the Prometheus character in VIP Mud before attempting to install this pack. ***

1: If you're a member of the soundpack's dropbox folder, follow these directions:

1.1: Select all folder contents and copy them to your clipboard. DO NOT CUT THEM!
1.2: Locate your VIP mud directory. This is usually c:\Users\Username\Documents\VIP Mud.
1.3: Enter the folder and paste the contents of the clipboard. Answer yes to the prompt to replace files if needed.

2: If you are using the dropbox link, updated regularly along with the pack, follow these directions:
2.1 Download the zip archive to your VIP Mud directory, usually c:\users\username\documents\VIP Mud.
2.2 Extrac the contents of the file to your VIP Mud directory. Answer yes or replace files in destination if prompted to overwrite files.

First time users, it is recommended to copy the provided settings.set file to your prometheus folder in VIP Mud once you've copied over the pack. If you are not a first time user, you can ignore this step.

A useful hint:
There's a sounds.ini file included with the pack that should prevent your soundpack from throwing errors at you when in combative situations, or other situations where many sounds are playing. Make sure that this is one of the files that gets selected.

Thank you for using the unofficial official VIP pack for Prometheus!
